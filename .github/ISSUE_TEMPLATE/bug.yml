**GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING BUGS**

1. A **brief description of the problem**—typically a line or two at most.

2. **Concise, dependency-free code which reproduces the problem**, otherwise known as a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) example.

3. **Complete stack traces for all errors—please use formatted text inside issues, not screenshots**.

4. Other things as applicable: **operating system**, **comparative performance timings** for performance issues.
